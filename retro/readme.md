# Retro Sites

Made from 2006 - 2009.

This is a sampling of sites designed as a hobby while I was in high school, using basic HTML/CSS, and on occassion, snippets of JS and PHP.

Sites that have a working live sample are probably not up to snuff, so don't expecty them to be fully functional. If you'd just like a snapshot of a blast from the past, head on over to the [screenshots directory](https://github.com/kylewjackson/web-dev-projects/tree/master/retro/screenshots).

## Disclaimer

It should be noted that I've come a long way since making these sites, so they should not be seen as evidence of the quality of my current work. However, it's neat to see the state of things back before the era of responsive design and more advanced coding practicies. Also, many of these are fansites containing copyrighted images of characters from different media properties, of which I claim no ownership. They were used solely for an individual hobby with no monetization, and fall under [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use).

Also bear in mind that some of the content shown, especially in blogs, were from the minds of late-2000s teenagers. There shouldn't be anything explicit/inapproriate, but on the off chance, these statements do not reflect my current views on any of the topics discussed.
