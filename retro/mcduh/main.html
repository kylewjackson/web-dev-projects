<h1>That thing we call the biz of show<h2>9/24/07</h2></h1>
<p>Here are three show reviews:<p>

<p><u>Gossip Girl Series Premiere:</u></p>

<p>So, Gossip Girl premiered on The CW last Wednesday, and I have to say...not a miss for the creator of th O.C. I never really got into the O.C. Not sure why, I just didn't. And I'll admit, I was really going to give this show a chance because 1) the title...seemed like another lame teen-angsty drama and 2) it would be on the same time as Private Practice and Bionic Woman. However, when I heard Kristen Bell was going to be involved, I was definitely turned on to it. I still had some lingering doubts though. I never expected to choose it over the other two shows competing with it. However, much to my surprise, I really did enjoy it. (Prepare for some spoilers along the way)</p>

<p>It started out a little slow, as if we were already supposed to know what was going on. However, things were quickly explained, still leaving more answers to be desired. OK, so to make things clear first, Gossip Girl is an online blogger who posts the happenings of the children of the rich and famous in Manhattan. The characters attend a private school, in which everyone's lives are practically run by Gossip Girl. The blogger is unseen and unknown, but is voiced by Kristen Bell. I thought she was great for the part. I have to admit, I kept thinking Veronica Mars when I heard her voice, but I thought her tone was perfect for the...should I say non-character? Kind of sexy sounding, with some sass, and a little bit of "I don't care...but you do." going on in the way she said things.</p>

<p>The show centers around Serena, a girl who used to be on the wrong side of the tracks, who mysteriously moves away for a year to boarding school for unknown reasons. She comes back sporting the bad-girl-gone-good attitude and most people don't believe it. Her best friend, Blair, is stung by the way things were left with Serena. She is now the new queen bee, so to speak, at the school and is worried about things going back to how they used to be, yet still longs to reunite with her friend. Blair's longtime boyfriend Nate had a fling with Serena before she left, which we are left to assume this is her reason for leaving. There are other characters as well, including the siblings, Dan and Jenny. Dan is pretty much unseen in the school and couldn't get over an event in 9th grade when Serena spoke to him. Jenny wants to start off her high school life by building a reputation, making sure she's invited to the "Kiss on the Lips" party, by addressing the invites. There's also Serena's brother, who recently tried to commit suicide, which is the reason Serena is back. Dan and Jenny's father is a "wannabe" rocker who apparently had some sort of relationship with Serena's selfish mother. There's also Nate's father, who has his son's life almost completely planned out for him. Oh, and can't forget this show's closest thing to and antagonist at this point, Chuck.</p>

<p>So, the main plot begins with Serena finding Blair and her group, which includes Jenny. She doesn't receive an invitation to the "Kiss on the Lips" party. But of course, Jenny saved her one, when she made them. Serena goes to a hotel bar to try to patch things up with Blair, which seems to work. Then, she's taken back to the kitchen with Chuck, attempting to blackmail her about her fling with Nate, unaware that Nate is telling Blair at the same time. Serena doesn't comply and leaves in a huff, bumping into Dan, where she drops her cell phone. Dan returns the phone, as Serena's mother confronts her daughter about her going to the "Kiss on the Lips" party, Serena uses Dan as a patsy for getting out of it. She then decides to actually follow through with her fake plans with Dan and the two go to his dad's concert. While the "Kiss on the Lips" party is going on, Jenny goes upstairs with Chuck and thinks things are going to fast. She text messages her brother Dan, and he and Serena go to get her. They find Chuck forcing himself on Jenny and Dan punches Chuck. They take a cab back to Dan and Jenny's home, with all of the students, and maybe even Gossip Girl herself, watching.</p>

<p>So, I haven't read the books. But I would say the best thing to do is if you have, don't compare the series to them when you watch it. Remember, it takes its own creative license and is not a mere remake. Just because it isn't exactly the same, doesn't mean it's bad.</p>

<p>Overall, the show didn't disappoint. Sure, some of the events were a little cliched, but from what I'm told, The O.C. started off slow too. I would say give the show a chance and just Tivo Private Practice and/or Bionic Woman or watch them online. Giving this show a chance is definitely what you should do. Gossip Girl airs Wednesday's at 9/8c on The CW.</p>

<p><u>Heroes season 2 Premiere:</u></p>

<p>Well...that was worse than the Avatar premiere. xDDDD Seriously, WTH was that?? During the entire episode it's like we're not meant to have any idea what's going on. Some of the questions were answered along the way, but it was just so....lame. It's like they were going for this whole mystery thing, but it SO didn't do it for me. The whole thing with the twins didn't interest me at all. Nathan and his Lost-esque beard was just pathetic. The death threat pictures of Hiro's dad and Nathan and Peter's mother and everything that went along with them was corny, including Hiro's dad's "I will die today" and "I never thought it would be you" lines, which were just plain cliche. Not to mention the fact that there was no reason for Hiro's dad to do nothing about the attack; I mean come on. And Peter having amnesia....seriously? Isn't prime time a little to sophisticated for those plots? The whole thing with Kensei was downright stupid, imo. If that's what we're to expect from Hiro's journey in the past, I'm pretty much done caring. And where was Kristen Bell? That was something I was looking forward to.....but if her power is electricity, then it seems Peter has already met her. And what's the deal Claire's magical flying friend? xDDD Isn't a little bit early to be reusing powers? And everything involving Molly and Matt was lame. The whole episode just seemed like....extremely general, cliched, corny, and out of order. I hope it gets better. And if some of the plot makes more sense if having read the online graphic novel, will someone please tell me so I can catch up? They really need to explain everything in the show, not in extras. I don't see how anyone could have enjoyed that. Heroes airs on Monday at 9/8c on NBC.</p>

<p><u>Chuck Series Premiere</u></p>

<p>Well, at least one show on NBC tonight didn't suck. xDD In fact, it was quite good; a refreshing satirical comedy.</p>

<p><i>Chuck Bartowski is a socially awkward twenty-something who works as a computer expert at the Nerd Herd, a "Geek Squad" inspired techbench at his local Buy More, a local electronics retailer, with his best friend, Morgan Santos. Chuck's sister, Ellie, is a doctor who is constantly looking out for his best interests and wants to help him find a girlfriend. On the night of his birthday party, Chuck receives an e-mail from his former Stanford University roommate, Bryce Larkin, who is now a CIA agent. When he opens it, he unwittingly downloads an entire server of sensitive data, once only privy to the government of the United States, into his brain. Both the NSA and the CIA want the intelligence returned to them and dispatch agents of their own, Major John Casey and Sarah Walker, respectively, to retrieve the data. As Chuck experiences flashes of memory activated by certain subliminal triggers, he must use the knowledge he now possesses to help the government thwart assassins and international terrorists, thereby upending his previously uneventful life. Chuck's decision to keep his newfound occupation a secret from his family and friends and to live his life as normally as possible forces Casey and Walker to establish an uneasy alliance with the shared goal of protecting Chuck at all costs.</i> (From Wiki)</p>

<p>I really like the video game references and overall comedic style of the show. I can actually relate to Chuck, as odd as it sounds. xDDD You can check out Chuck, Mondays at 8/7c on NBC.</p>

<p><b>Rating: 9/10</b></p>

<p>So...expect more reviews in the next entry, which should be this Friday.</p>


<h1>Superstitious<h2>9/23/07</h2></h1>
<p>Psychic BB saying hi. xDDD Seriously.....I think I made some sort of weird premonition or something. xDDDD Ok, so, last night (well, technically 2 nights ago since it's after midnight) I was talking to a friend (who shall remian unnamed) and for relatively unknown reasons, during our Youtube fest, I decided to look up a song I hadn't heard in 5 years and give my friend the link. It was "I could not ask for more" by Sara Evans. So, the next day (yesterday) my friend went to a dance with her recent boyfriend. Then, she gets back later that night and we talk about it. After all that's said and done, later she starts to sing part of that song. I begin to join in a little bit. She asks the name of it and I tell her the title of it. Then, the weird part happens. She tells me that was one of the two slow songs at the dance and that it was sort of like her "song" with her bf. And I was like "o_0 freaky!" And she's like, "Why?" And I say, "Because I just showed you that video last night!!" And now she's like "OMG!" Turns out it was performed by a different person, but still. Some kind of odd prediction or coincidence or something. Then, after we quit talking....more freaky happenings ensue. I hear one of those cliched noises that's like air blowing that sounds like some kind of ghostly calling out moan thingy. I'm like "o_0!!!" and then I start thinking about all of this and I come up with one of the most interesting ideas I've ever had for a story. So, in hopes of not forgetting these happenings, I decided to turn all of this into a blog entry. So...yeah. xDD On a side note, when I got to the file manager page there was an ad for this thing called "Hallowmere" that's about ghosts and stuff. A little added creepy. And OMG!!! This is happening right as I'm writing this!! There's an episode of Fresh Prince on in the BG right now where Will's in a cemetery talking with ghosts!!! O_0 xDDDD Anyway, that's one of the more interesting happenings in my life lately. Oh and...go to <a href="http://avatarmasters.finessedreams.com" target="_blank">tAM</a> for my thoughts on the Avatar premiere. x]</p>

<p>P.S.<br>
Oh wow...just thought of something else. xDD We were watching Shania Twain videos too and she had that song in Miss Congeniality with Sandra Bullock who was in Premonition. o_0 xDDDDDDDDDDD</p>

<h1>((I'll do the title and song later))<h2>9/11/07</h2></h1>
<p>Ok...so first off, I'd like to take a moment to remember well...you know. *hums patriotic tune* xDD Ok, done. So, just got my <del>shitty</del> awesome laptop today and write now I'm typing this up on it, outside my house. Yep, pretty Colorado. ((my word for "cool")) Anyhoo, with premiere week right around the corner, I thought I'd do any entry about some of the new things coming this fall.</p>
<p>But first, a minor catastrophe. Bionic Woman, Gossip Girl, and Private Practice all have the same exact timeslot! Bummer!! Three new shows I was actually looking forward too are on at the same time, so now I'm forced to choose which I will follow. Yeah, sucks much. And with Veronica Mars and Gilmore Girls over, we now have to find new shows to occupy our Tuesday's. Hm...</p>
<p><b>Reaper</b> - The new show that shall be taking over our Tuesday nights, filling a hard timeslot to fill. Tuesday's at 9/8c is one of the most popular time slots in primetime, so you can see how starting a new show them can be both a good and a bad thing. Reaper follows the story of a man, who's parents sold his soul to the devil, and now he must collect escaped demon's from hell and return them there; a demon bounty hunter, if you will. Hm...interesting plot, very original and...Kevin Smith's involved; a combination for comedic gold. Reaper's definitely a "I think this is a comedy..." you don't want to miss. <i>The CW, Tuesday September 25, 9/8c</i></p>
<p><b>Bionic Woman</b> - A remake of the hit spin off of the Six-million Dollar Man. A widely anticipated show you probably don't want to miss. <i>NBC, Wednesday September 26, 9/8c.</i></p>
<p><b>Gossip Girl</b> - Based on the best-selling novel, Gossip Girl is a show that revolves around the web postings of an unknown blogger, who tells the story of the lives of a group of high school students. And with Kristen Bell, the star of the cult-hit Veronica Mars, as the voice of Gossip Girl, this is definitely a must-see. <i>The CW, Wednesday September 19, 9/8c</i></p>
<p><b>Private Practice</b> - The spin-off of the critically-acclaimed Grey's Anatomy which revolves around the life of Dr. Addison Shepherd after she leaves Seattle Grace hospital. Starring not only Kate Walsh, but Taye Diggs (Kevin Hill, RENT), Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy), and Chris Lowell (Veronica Mars). With lots of star power and Cred from Grey's, this is yet another must see. <i>ABC, Wednesday September 26, 9/8c</i></p>
<p>And of course your favorite shows are returning including Nip/Tuck, Grey's Anatomy, and Heroes (which will have Kristen Bell this season, yay!). So, with a great line-up, there's lots of reasons to be getting your homework out of the way early. xDD</p>
