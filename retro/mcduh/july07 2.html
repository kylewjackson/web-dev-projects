<h1>In the End<h2>Date: 7/11/07</h2></h1>
Well, all good things must come to an end. Well, technically this isn't the end. I already talked about most of the styff I had been ranting about in my head, so I don't have much left to rant about. Hence, I'll only be posting here when I have something I really want to talk about. Until then, cya.<br><br>

<h1> "Ordinary Day"  <h2>Date: 7/04/07</h2></h1>
So, since I spent the last few entries talking about one subject, I'm just going to kick back today. Nothing special, other than the holiday of course. xDD Anyway, happy 4th everyone!<br><br>
Oh and "Losing Grip" was the winner of the last poll, with 4 votes. Here's the next edition.<br><br>

<h1>"Angel" Pt. 3 <h2>Date: 7/03/07</h2></h1>
Let's continue:<br><br>
<b>Gone, but not forgotten: Angel, pt. 3</b><br>

<p><img src="#" border="0" alt="icon"><br><b>Angel</b> -  Angel, the main character of the series, is one of the best. Tall, dark, brooding; everything a great hero needs to be. xDD He is of course a vampire, with a soul. He fights for redemption for the things he did as a vampire. He is the chosen champion of the Powers That Be.</p>

<p><img src="#" border="0" alt="icon"><br><b>Cordy</b> -  Cordelia, although superficial at a glance, is much more complex than imaginable. Her role gradually grows throughout the series until it completely eclipses Angel in all his glory. One of my favs.</p>

<p><img src="#" border="0" alt="icon"><br><b>Wesley</b> -  He was pretty dorky in Buffy, I'll admit, but Wesley grew so much as a character throughout the Angel series. He even becomes more likable than Angel himself as some points. He's much more of a badass than he appears.</p>

<p><img src="#" border="0" alt="icon"><br><b>Fred</b> -  The cutest character ever! LOL Winifred, or "Fred" is my all tiem favorite character in a series EVER. She mixes comedy, with coy, with downright wackiness. I love her to bits.</p>

<p>Sorry I didn't mention all of the characters. Running kind of short on time here. (Shout out to Gunn, Conner, Doyle, Spike, and Lorne. LOL) On to my score:</p>

<p>By now, you should know most of my views on the series, so I'll just give the score. <b>A 9.5/10.</b> The series is extremely excellent and would have gotten a 10/10 if it weren't for the fourth season, but alas, not all things can be perfect. If you plan on watching this, BE SURE TO WATCH BUFFY SEASON 1 - 3 FIRST!! The show will make absolutely no sense unless you do. you might want to watch the whole Buffy series before tackling Angel to get the full benefit. Well, until next time, cya!</p><br>

<h1>"Angel" Pt. 2 <h2>Date: 7/02/07</h2></h1>
Let's continue:<br><br>
<img src="#" border="0" alt="cordy"><br><b>Gone, but not forgotten: Angel, pt. 2</b><br>
<p><b>Season 3</b> -  This is the season I consider to be the best. It has all of my favorite characters, some of the best twists, and my favorite shipping! Although some of the aspects are less than desirable, this season still proves to be one of the best. With Fred as a main characters, the storyline only becomes more in-depth. A certain someone's mysterious pregnancy kept people hooked as well. And the season's second half conflict is probably one of the best in the series. Conner is the most interesting and most annoying characters in the show. The ending was one of the saddest in the shows history.</p>
<p><b>Season 4</b> - This is where I begin to become unamused. This season is poor, plain and simple. Although the Wesley/Lilah relationship was rather interesting, all of the events with Conner and Cordy were just plain horrific, leaving nothing to be desired. Cordy became my most hated character during this season. Although this season had the most cliffhangers and most twists, it couldn't measure up to previous ones. I felt some relief during the season's final events, with its hooking plot and the way it all wrapped up. Even though I always hate watching it, it's a must see season in the series simply for the plot expansion.</p>
<p><b>Season 5</b> - The final season was the quality of the second season. Pretty good, but nothing extremely spectacular. The tie of loose ends with Cordy and Conner was very good, but the whole atmosphere was just plain wrong. Working at Wolfram & Hart? Ugh. But despite that, this season was great, if only for its purely awesome shipping. This was definitely the saddest season of a show in TV history for me. As much as I hate to admit it, this is the only TV/Movie/etc. I have ever cried because of. For those who have seen the later part of the season, before Illyria's arrival, will know why. Anyway, although the actual ending was a little annoying, the season was a great wrap-up for the series.</p>
<p>I'll do character bios and the final review in the next entry. (Wow, a three parter xDD)<br>

<h1>"Angel" Pt. 1 <h2>Date: 7/01/07</h2></h1>
First off, I'm going to hold of the SotD for a while, because to be frank, I was just picking a random site and saying good things about it. I want to have more meaning behind a chosen site, so until I see something I really want to commend, I'm going to hold off. All 6 of June's entries have been archived, for those of you wondering where they have gone. Now, for my brand new section. I'll be reviewing a TV shows that have ended and just.....talking about it. The section will be called "Gone, but not forgotten." So here it goes:<br><br>
<img src="angel.png" border="0" alt="angel"><br><b>Gone, but not forgotten: Angel</b><br>
<p><i>Angel</i> started out as a simple spin-off of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, not expected to measure up to it's parent series, which was true during the first season. However, the second season really caused a spark inside of fans, when the plot became more in-depth and a general knowledge of the series' past was required to fully understand the storyline, which cause viewers to watch week-after-week. The cliffhanger endings and jaw-dropping sequences only grew as the series continued on. Until the series ended in one of the biggest cliff-hangers imaginable. (In fact, my hometown TV Guide said they considered it to be the worst Series Finale in television history, due to the fact that so much was left open.) The series climbed in the ratings, but gradually dropped towards the end, causing the WB to set its cancellation, even with all of the Crew and Fan support behind the series. I'll talk about each season individually, alond with the analyzation of several characters. (May contain slight SPOILERS)</p>
<p><b>Season 1</b> -  The season that started off rather slow, but sped up with the loss of who seemed to be a major character. This made the ratings pick up as a former BtVS character, Wesley, replaced the lost character. Then, a slew of new characters, including Gunn, were introduced, as well as several guest appearances by Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy and Eliza Dushku as Faith. Another so called skyrocket in the ratings. Then, the season ended on what seemed to be the most mysterious event the series could entail, the revival of a minor character from Buffy, with a major role in the events to come.<p>
<p><b>Season 2</b> - This is where the real plot began to kick in. With Gunn joining them team, the possibilities seemed endless. Then, when the group discovers the revived character, a series of events begin to take place that would lead to the entire timeline of the series. I won't SPOIL to much, but these events involve a certain character returning to their original ways for a short time, ending in "perfect darkness." Then, the series introduced the new character, Lorne, who runs a demon karaoke bar, as odd as it sounds. Then, if that all wasn't enough, the final episodes of the season in a foreign land called Pylea. This introduces a new female character named, Fred. When the group returns home, they find Willow, a character from Buffy, sitting with a sad face on their couch. (Those of you who have seen Season 5 of BtVS know what this event is.)<p>
<p>Well, since there is so much to cover, I'm going to continue in the next entry.</p>
