<h1>"Sanctuary" <h2>Date: 6/30/07</h2></h1>
Alright, three things to do today. First off, the SotD:<br><br>
<a href="http://freewebs.com/avatarharmony" target="_blank">Avatar Harmony</a><br>
<p>Avatar Harmony is a great site. It has lots of content, a decent layout, and the most active owner you could ask for. The graphics are great, the info is great, and the atmosphere is great. Not much left to say. The onve drawbacks I see are the header image being a bit over-sized and for some reason I receive a "missing plug-ins" message when I load the site. But still, the site is very good and I hope to see it around for a long time. Now for my first mini-rant of the day.</p>
<b>Japanese Gaming: Kingdom Hearts</b><br>
<p>It's no secret that gaming is much more popular in Japan. Not only that, its quality is better too. Games that release over there would make certain fans state-side melt in their seats. One of the biggest is probably Kingdom Hearts. A "Final Mix" version of each game has released in Japan, but not in any other country. The first Final Mix we could have easily lived without. It just boosted some stats, some new keyblades, basically nothing to essential. However, the next two remakes of the game have much more to offer. Cutscenes and videos essential to the next game in the series, which could very well effect the storyline, were included. New cutscenes involving an important event surrounding certain mysterious characters revealed in the previous game's secret video, were in KH2:Final Mix, which could effect the non-Japanese gamer's outlook on the next installment, which hardly seems fair. In addition and entire remake of a game for a new console was released, causing much more turmoil towards Japan from other gamers. How can they not include us on such important events to the series if they plan on continuing it in other countries? It's an injustice that will probably never be attended to. Now for my next mini-rant.</p>
<b>G4 Sucks!!</b><br>
<p>Everyone knows that supposedly technology based TV channel, G4, has become almost unwatchable as of late. It started with the drop of certain shows, then the invasion of completely irrelevant shows like The Man show, Star Trek, Cops, Cheaters, and much more garbage. The only show remotely watchable these days in X-play, and it has gotten a lot crappier than it used to be. G4 used to be my little sanctuary for my interests and now, it's just nothing. When will the quality return? Will it ever return?? Well, that's all for today.</p>
<br>


<h1>"Wonderwall" <h2>Date: 6/29/07</h2></h1>
<p>Okay, to start things off, I'd like to point out that I re-did the layout, even though it might be slightly less-noticeable than most changes. I felt the content space needed to be larger, I needed to add a "links" page to the navigation, and I wanted to designate a space for both the song and hit counter. I added a comment widget as well at the bottom of the main page. I added a little forum you guys can use if you like too, on the "other" page. I'm holding off the SotD today, since I kind of spent a lot of time on the layout, so I didn't have a chance to browse many sites. Now onto business.</p>
<br>
<b>Cover Bands: No Talent Wannabees?</b>
<br>
<p>A big question among the subject of cover bands is the question: "Are they rip-off artists or tribute artists?" First, let's start off with the definiton of a Cover 
Band.<br>
<li><u>Cover Band</u> - A cover band (or covers band) is a band that plays only cover songs, a new rendition of an older song, re-preformed. Most wedding bands can be considered cover bands. Another term is party band. <i>(Courtesy of Wikipedia)</i><br>
<p>So, to sum it up, a Cover Band is a band that plays songs by other bands. Off the bat that already sounds like a rip-off group. However, many Cover Bands are considered Tribute Bands, or a band that plays songs to tribute the band that originally preformed them. This is where determination can get tricky.</p>
<p>One argument is that cover bands are just an excuse for those with no creative abilities to get exposure. Another argument is that they do play them not only for exposure, but to allow others to experience the song they are paying tribute to, or even just to fill in time when they aren't playing originals. The most common cover today is most likely, Wonderwall, originally debuted by the British Rock band, Oasis. Since its release in the mid-90's, Wonderwall has been professionally covered 3 times, and has been amateurly covered countless times. Usually, however, when a professional artist covers a song by another professional artist, it is considered to be a remake. Why is the reproduction of Wonderwall always considered a cover? Another issue surrounding this is Cartel's cover of Wonderwall. Cartel remade this song and it was considered to have a better sound than the original by some, and considered to be a rip-off by others. This all boils down to the root of the debate of Cover Bands.</p>
<p>So how does the argument usually pan out? People who write their own material obviously think cover bands are jokes, while cover bands usually think the opposite. The majority of people aren't strongly biased, but if they were asked, they would most likely say that they want to hear original, therefore favoring the rip-off position. Many bands that do write their own songs will vouch for Cover Bands, because they may have started out as one or they know the difficulty of writing songs and can understand a band doing covers.</p>
<p>It all depends on your personal creative beliefs. I myself support Cover Bands, but hope that they write some original songs as well. When you think about it, what band didn't start out doing a cover in one form or another? When learning to play instruments, they more than likely practiced songs preformed by professional musicians as part of the learning process. Many of which probably even preformed covers at their first gigs. In my opinion, it's unfair to call a Cover Band "no talent wannabees" since it's all a part of the learning technique. However, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Tell me yours in our comment system located at the bottom of this page, or in the chat box, or in the mini-forums.</p>
<br>
Now it's time for the first annual "Every Five entries Poll" I'll start a poll every five entries and ask you which of them was your favorite. The poll will close after the next five entries are posted.

<h1>"Losing Grip" <h2>Date: 6/28/07</h2></h1>
So let's get this out of the way. Today's "SotD" is:<br><br>
<a href="http://www.freewebs.com/tenshi-graphics" target="_blank">Tenshi Graphics</a>
<br><br>
Tenshi Graphics is run by Koi, who recently ran into some trouble due to the misinterpretation of Shiganorie's blog. Anyway, I chose TG because I can tell that once they get up on their feet, they'll be the next great thing. Koi has a lot of potential as a graphics designer and if he would make his own layout, the site would be even better. xDD (no offense of course, just kind of odd a graphics site not having their own layout) Anyway, I hope to see more from this site in the future. Now, time for my daily ramble. 
<br><br>
<b>American TV Networks: Losing Grip on the Audience</b>
<br>
<p>It's no surprise that network television has lost its credibility over the years. With all of the crap reality shows and crime dramas, it's to be expected. Few quality shows have made it to the small screen in the past decade. 2004 seemed like the year that would all change with the premiere of Grey's Anatomy, Veronica Mars, Desperate Housewives, and Lost. However, the quality of these amazing shows quickly diminished.</p>

<p>Veronica Mars, although every episode was amazing, lost a lot of quality in it's third and final season. However, it was still MUCH better than anything else on television. The CW chose to cancel the series, in order to make room for such future crap piles as Hidden Palms, Gossip Girl, and Reaper, all of which have horrible (and typical) plots. Grey's Anatomy, along with Lost and Desperate Housewives, lost most of its spark in its third season, unable to keep as gripped. The only high point in the season for me was Meredith's "almost drowning" incident when Dr. McMoron thinks she just let herself sink in the water or something stupid like that. It all turns out to be this giant metaphor for she doesn't want to date him anymore. Very sad and pathetic. Lost, although gripping in its first half of the season, became extremely silly in the last part of the season. The whole Jacob event was downright poor writing. The whole "it's all a plan of the island" crap from Lock is getting old too. Desperate Housewives was rather gripping in its season finale, but not as gripping as regular episode endings from the second season. (From what I've seen, that is)</p>

<p>Cancellation of TV shows is even more of a problem. Networks can't seem to let the quality shows have their full run. Wonderfalls, easily in my top 10 shows of all time, was canceled after a mere four episodes at the hand of Fox. Dead Like Me only lived 2 seasons, when much more story was left. Angel was canceled when it obviously had a much larger time-line ahead of it, as displayed by the rushed feel of the final season. Even the actors are losing faith in the power of TV, as seen in the ending of Gilmore Girls, because both main stars felt that they couldn't do it anymore, despite even the network's opinions.</p>

<p>Bottom line, quality has sunk. It's said that the most quality programming comes from Syndication Cable Networks like FX, TNT, and USA; all of which are known for their provocative, porn-like material. However, Nip/Tuck has seriously been lacking since Season 3 and Dirt never seemed to even tread water. Shows like CSI, Law & Order, American Idol, 24, etc. keep dominating the ratings, when each is just a clone of something done before. No originality remains in network television, resulting in a loss of normal viewers, yet a whole new audience of unintelligible nitwits to gawk at their crap.</p>

<p>You know when the Pussycat Dolls reality show gets higher ratings than Veronica Mars, perhaps the best show EVER to be on television, the world is slowly coming to an end. Why to people allow themselves to be dominated by filth like Maury, Jerry Springer, Top Model, American Idol, The Bachelor, and everything else you could experience in REAL LIFE. The point of TV is to watch fiction. F-I-C-T-I-O-N. Not real life. (If it were actually real, of course.) Get a clue America, get a clue networks, and get a non-believers, no one with half a brain enjoys the "top" programming these days and it is definitely will show in the future.</p>
<br>

<h1>"Feel Good Time" <h2>Date: 6/27/07</h2></h1>
Well, after my last entry took a little time, I'm going to just sit back an relax with this one. You guys can do the same and just feel good about the things I said. xDDDD Anyway, in case you haven't gotten the drift, my blog will be like "anti-shiganorie" blog. She's very critical, while I praise the good stuff. I guess this could be like relief from whatever she causes next. (no offense xDD) All of the entry titles are song titles, if you haven't noticed. The song that plays is also the latest entry song, so since the titles pertain to the context of the entry, it would be hard to do requests, so don't ask please. Anyway, I'd like to give a quick shout-out to all of you guys who are read my last entry and hope you liked it. Well, I guess I'll go ahead and do my new thing, "Site of the Day." Today's site is:<br><br>
<a href="http://awakenedspirit.co.nr" target="_blank">Awakened Spirit</a>
<br><br>
I know they've taken some bashing from "Dazed" today and I would like to mention the good about this site, since it seem no one else will. :-\ First off, you manage to do what most don't, give credit where credit is due. Most people don't bother, so it's good that you do. LOL Anyway, you have a decent amount of content, which is also good. And I LOVE your icons. The style is both fresh and reminds me of what I've seen before at the same time. Mixing classic with new, I like it. The site has a lot of potential and I know that someday it will make us all proud. ^__^
<br><br>

<h1>"What I Like About You" (Avatar Edition)<h2>Date: 6/26/07</h2></h1>
Well, for my first official "talk about something" entry, my topic is going to be, you guessed it, you guys! LOL Come on, you know you wanna hear about yourselves for a change. First off, I'll talk about my best buddies.<br><br>
<b>Siani</b> - Starlight Designs<br>
My main squeeze. xDD Siani is an amazing graphics designer. She's also mah e-babe. xDD I met her about the same time as my e-bff, animegal, on Avatar Goodies, a forum run by the eccentric Bumi. Siani has always been a pal, making me graphics, helping me get started with my sites, offering advice, and talking with me late into the night, even though she's dead tired ALL THE TIME. xDD She's been a real influence in the avatar fansite community, as her topsite shows, as well as an influence in my site. She'll always be awesome.
<br><br>
<b>Animegal</b> - Avatar Oasis<br>
Ah yes, what can I say about dear animegal? Other than being the bestest, emo-ish, e-bff ever, nothing. xDD But seriously, I don't know a single person who could honestly say they don't like animegal. She's nice, she's funny, and she's got an extreme personality to boot. It's always fun talking with her. She runs her own Avatar site, which is awesome, and she is one of the founders of a VERY great fanfic/rp, The Village. Animegal is a great pal and I wouldn't trade her for anyone.
<br><br>
<b>Suki</b> - Avatar Harmony<br>
Suki, wherever you are, Suki's there. I have to give Suki props for being one of the most interactive affiliates I've ever had. Suki's ALWAYS checking in and using the cboxes for the purpose they were intended. I swear, I don't know how Suki finds the time to keep up with EVERYONE. And to top it all off, Suki manages to maintain their own site. Wow. Suki, I know most of my days on avatar fansites would be quite empty without you. I'm sure many others would say the same.
<br><br>
<b>Sam</b> - Yume-Mirai (Formerly Water Tribe)<br>
Sam is......well.....Sam. xDD Not sure how else to put it. Water Tribe represented exactly what an Avatar Fansite is. Right down to the core. No other way to explain it. And it wouldn't have been that way without Sam. Sam sets the standard for what a great webmaster is. And yeah.....we share a few secrets. *wink*
<br><br>
<b>Bumi</b> - Avatar Goodies<br>
Bumi, Bumi, Bumi. Bumi isn't you run-of-the-mill admin, he's.....special? xDD He always makes his new members feel included on his well known forum. I know it can be tough when your members don't stick around as long as you'd like, but the thing about Bumi is that he's persistent, always thinking of ways to draw those who came back. He always has something new going. And I have to commend him for that.
<br><br>
<b>Koi</b> - Tenshi Graphics (Formerly Spirit Oasis)<br>
Koi, he's not so popular around this community anymore and I think that's a shame. It's not that he did anything wrong, it's the fact that people took what Norie said wrong and put blame on him. And that is a shame. Koi has a great personality, always striving to be the best he can be. Spirit Oasis showed that and so does his effort in all of his sites. It's clear he admires the work everyone has done in the community, and strives to measure up, which I think he does. Koi's shown a lot of improvement throughout this whole run, and I commend that.
<br><br>
<b>The Rest</b><br>
<p>Okay, so I can't name everyone. I don't know everyone as well as I'd like to. But what I do know, I'll list here:</p>
<b>Pon de Replay</b> - Awesome Graphics site, one that I think everyone wants to be like.<br>
<b>Konoko14</b> - Shows skill in everything they do, as reflected by Trigger Happy.<br>
<b>Crystalline</b> - Can't remember what site they run for the love of me, but I know it's a name that makes me smile when I see it.<br>
<b>Greaterfire</b> - One of the best uses I've seen of tables in a while at Elemental. Greaterfire takes pride in what they do and it shows in the site.<br>
<b>Stanstan</b> - The quiet guy. LOL You don't hear from stanstan to often, but it is a name you recognize. I have a feeling he's watching from the distance, nodding his head at the great work he sees from all of us. He's had a great effect on the community, even if you don't hear from him a lot.<br>
<b>Everyone Else</b> - If I didn't mention you, it's not because I dislike you, it's because I haven't heard enough from you. Try to make a name in the community and the next time I highlight specific people, I'm sure you'll be one of them. Or, it could just be because I'm at a loss for names, in which case I'll add you when I remember you. xDD
<br><br>

<h1>"My First Single"<h2>Date: 6/25/07</h2></h1>
Well, with some inspiration from Norie's infamous blog, I decided to start my own. 
But, no no, you won't find any crude rants here, just the normal, nice ones. xDD Check 
often for my daily ramblings.
<br><br>
