<p>"Where has BB been?! Who's to blame?! Blame Canada!!" xDDD Hi...um...back? Well, I just started school Monday and I'm pretty wiped...with the whole slacking thing going on for, oh, say, 3 months? But I'm good, my classes are easy, and...all around me things seem to be crumbling. I couldn't maintain my KH site, so I just redirected it to the forum. I'm in a sort of graphics funk. Compared to some of my classmates, I'm a n00b. And none of my shows are back yet. (Plus VM is canceled T__T) But still, all is well, and I'm here. I should be posting a little more here and hopefully keeping my remaining sites up and running. Also, you might be seeing a few little JAVA widgets and stuff, since I'm taking a JAVAscript class. Oh...and...name change. Woot! I'm known as B.B. Valentine now. Got it...memorized? xDD *coughsdorkismecoughs* Anyway, I'll be doing a little rant next entry, which will hopefully be tomorrow. Oh, and I'll now be accepting affiliates and links!! Just e-mail me at <a href="mailto:flameaxelviii@aol.com">FlameAxelVIII@aol.com</a> and I'll put you up!! And...you guys stay cool!</p>
