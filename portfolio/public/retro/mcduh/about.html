<h1>Contact</h1>

AIM: FlameAxelVIII<br>
MSN: FlameAxelViii@aol.com (as odd as it sounds)<br><br>
You'll most likely catch me in AIM, if you actually want to talk, which I'm usually up for. 

<h1>The Blog</h1>
With inspiration from the writings of <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/adazed" target="_blank">Norie</a>, I decided to make a blog to use as my small personal website, which had been in the works for a while. The blog was started on June 25th, 2007. The name comes from a long story that happened a while ago. (If you IM me in AIM, I'll tell you it) You can interpret it how you like though. (My favorite is that it's a spin on the McDreamy/McSteamy thing on Grey's Anatomy ^__^) The blog will just be my personal ramblings from time to time, usually about the latest episode of my favorite show.

<h1>Me: blacKbird</h1>
<p>Bet you're wondering about the name, huh? xDD Well, it started back in March 2006 when my friend from school started a <a href="http://agonize.proboards55.com" target="_blank">forum</a> and asked me to join. They are well.....emo/goth......so that translated to the forum. (No offense to any of you emo/goth type people out there xDD) I wanted to pick a name that would fit in, so I chose blackbird97.  The 97 means nothing. No, it's not the year I was born. No, it's not my favorite number. It's just a number. xDD Anyway, when I joined a <a href="http://kingdomhearts.rpgplanet.gamespy.com/forums" target="_blank">Kingdom Hearts forum</a> in Summer 2006, I shortened the name to just blacKbird, because people were always asking about the 97. LOL Anyway, the reason I capitalize the K is because that's the first letter of my name, Kyle. So that's the story of that.</p>

<p>Anyway, my first forum was called, you guessed it, <a href="http://blackbirdforum.proboards54.com" target="_blank">Blackbird Forum</a>. xDD During my Kingdom Hearts craze, it turned into <a href="http://khultimainsider.co.nr" target="_blank">KH Ultima Insider</a>. It had a few members and was my little haven. I started a few unsuccessful forums too, <a href="http://z6.invisionfree.com/Slayers_Alter" target="_blank">Slayers Alter</a> and <a href="http://pokecentre.proboards88.com" target="_blank">PokeCentre</a>. Eventually though, I wanted to expand to websites, due to the influence from online friends, <a href="http://starlight.finessedreams.com" target="_blank">Siani</a> and <a href="http://finessedreams.com/avataroasis" target="_blank">Animegal</a>. So, I began to transform it to a memorable name, <a href="http://cloudchasers.proboards107.com" target="_blank">KH Cloudchasers</a>. However, at this time I became much more interested in Avatar, so started <a href="http://avatarmasters.proboards98.com" target="_blank">The Avatar Masters forum</a> in late December 2006. Then, in early 2007, I expanded to <a href="http://freewebs.com/theavatarmasters" target="_blank">Freewebs</a>, making my own site. Then, in February, the site moved to the <a href="http://finessedreams.com" target="_blank">Finesse Dreams</a> domain, while I started my Kingdom Hearts site, <a href="http://khcloudchasers.net" target="_blank">KHC</a>. I got all of those up and running, then began planning my Graphics site and Personal site. My Graphics site, <a href="http://fantasyshine.khcloudchasers.net" target="_blank">Fantasy shine Designs</a>, opened in June 2007 on the KHC domain, followed by this blog, later that month. I also tried my luck at a tv-based forum, <a href="http://entertainius.proboards104.com" target="_blank">Entertainius</a>, but no luck getting that going.</p>

<p>Now that my resume is done, time to talk about me. xDD Well, I'm 15, I'm a Sophomore, and I go to Public High School. I did play Alto Saxophone the Marching Band, but I dropped out of it. I watch a lot of TV, do a lot of gaming, and make a lot of graphics. xDD My favorite shows are Veronica Mars, Buffy, Angel, Gilmore Girls (ugh....but sadly, true), That '70s Show, Nip/Tuck, Grey's Anatomy, Dead Like Me, Avatar (duh), Heroes, Lost, and X-play. My favorite games are Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, Devil May Cry, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Halo, and Bioshock.</p>

<h1>The New Name: B.B. Valentine</h1>
First off, people call me BB because of blacKbird. And my bff is animegal, who is totally nuts over Vincent Valentine. They're e-married. xDD We have this thing going with Siani where I'm married to her and animegal is her mother and my mother. Ew...incest. xDD Not really, Siani is e-adopted and I'm e-biological, so I married my e-legal sibling. @__@ <i>These are the days of our lives.</i> xDDDD Anyway, that's where the Valentine part comes in. And the B.B. is to make it look more like a name. hehe.
