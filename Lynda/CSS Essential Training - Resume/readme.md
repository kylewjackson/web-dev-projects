# CSS Essential Training Resume Project

### Course taught by [Christina Truong](https://www.lynda.com/Christina-Truong/7842227-1.html).

The main project in this 3-part course was a responsive, CSS-styled resume. This resume was based on my skillset at the time of completing the course toward the end of 2018.
