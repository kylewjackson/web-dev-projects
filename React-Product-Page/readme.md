# React Product Page Demo

Version 1.1 beta

*September 30, 2019*

This product page demo was made with React.JS, and is fully funtional, but is currently only styled for mobile. A [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/fv202Jfted2mYOvnBm0hfZ/Shopping-Demo?node-id=0%3A1) can be found for a preview of what the final product will look like on completion. As of now the project is solely Front End, so any registration/login functionality is for demo purposes only.

Readable [demo code](https://github.com/kylewjackson/web-dev-projects/tree/master/React-Product-Page/demo-code/demo.js) can be found in this repo as a [subfolder](https://github.com/kylewjackson/web-dev-projects/tree/master/React-Product-Page/demo-code).
