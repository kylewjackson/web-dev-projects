      <li>Writer Joss Whedon</li>
      <li>Starring Kristy Swanson, Donald Sutherland, and Luke Perry</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whedon attempted to subvert the "blonde cheerleader damel-in-distress" trope common in horror films, with the gimmick being she was what the monsters should ultimately fear.</p>
    <p>The show follows the events of the movie, in that it presents Buffy's life following her family moving to Sunnydale, but the movie itself is not considered canon.</p>
    <code>A comic book adapation of the movie called Buffy Origins was released in subsequent years, and more closely resmembles Whedon's original script. While not written by himself, Whedon has stated that, aside from a few details, the comic is mostly canon.</code>
    <p>Whedon was ultimately disatisfied with alterations made to his script, which included changes to tone, dialogue, and plot. He became frustrated and walked off set, disowning the project entirely.</p>

    <p>Buffy has inspired tons of merchandise, been the subject of several podcasts, and is constantly being referenced as one of the most influential programs to have aired on television.</p>
    <code>Buffy in the context of 2018 is sometimes problematic, in terms of racial diversity, bisexual erasure, and feminism, but as long as those issues are acknowledged, I think the show can still be enjoyed.</code>
    <p>A reboot is planned, having been annouced in July 2018. Monica Owusu-Breen will be showrunning, with Joss Whedon producing. The showrunner has confirmed that the show will serve as a continuation, rather than a remake.</p>
