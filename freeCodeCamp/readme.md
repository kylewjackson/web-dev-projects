# FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Projects

Here is a [codepen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/npPeRk/) for the 5 final projects of the FCC Responsive Design curriculum. Here is my [certifcate of completion](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/kylewjackson/responsive-web-design).

These versions are somewhat barebones, since I finished them with the intent of moving onto the next lessons quickly. I'll probably continue to tweak them over time, but I feel like they're a decent representation of the concepts learned in the curriculum.

### *Note*: when using the test script, make sure the correct test suite is selected from the dropdown menu.
